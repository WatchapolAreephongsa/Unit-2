# Comparing Coding Languages

In this semester’s computer science class and my own research, I learned about 2 codings languages and 1 type of coding language which are Python, C, 
and esoteric language. Today, I would like to compare and contrast these languages based on my knowledge and research. First of all, the simplicity of the language,
python will be the simplest language among these 3 since it’s object-oriented which makes it very easy to learn,
understand and make a clear code. C, on the other hand, is procedurally oriented which means it is close to the machine language make it harder to learn and the most 
complex one is esoteric because it is the language that is designed for a specific group of people. Secondly, used and purpose of each language, Python is designed to do general or basic tasks to some advanced task which Python’s strength is the variety of tasks
it can do because it can be used to create some easy calculation program to some application or machine learning which are some harder project. C is another language that can still be used in many tasks but less than python. 
However, C has some unique tasks that it can do and python cannot such as the used of C with Arduino to create many circuits which can be used in many different ways. Lastly, esoteric language is the coding
language designed to challenge the computer capacity or challenge someone such as Befunge that is designed to make it become almost impossible to compile. In conclusion, 
I learned that different languages have their own pros and cons which the user needs to understand before they can use it effectively for some specific project.
